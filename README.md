# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what we've learn't in the Dicee tutorial (lesson 7 in the Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart course). This app will guide us through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and you will be applying what you have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What we will create

Weâ€™re going to make a magical 8 ball app, it will give us the answers to all the tricky questions in life. We can make the ball change at the press of a button.
